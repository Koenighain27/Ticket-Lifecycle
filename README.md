<h1>osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle: Intake Through Resolution</h1>
This tutorial outlines the lifecycle of a ticket from intake to resolution within the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket.<br />

<h2>Ticket Lifecycle Stages</h2>

- Intake
- Assignment and Communication
- Working the Issue
- Resolution

<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

In this section, we'll create a ticket as a user and then receive the ticket as a help desk professional and familizarize ourselves with the process of resolving a ticket. First, go to http://localhost/osTicket/ and then click "Open a new ticket". Create a new ticket using the user account we created earlier. This user is reporting the mobile online banking is down. She is able to categorize this issue thanks to the help topics we added in the previous section.

Now, login as an agent we created. I logged in as jane.doe and as we can see, the ticket we created is shown. Click on the ticket and now we can see information about the ticket and are able to change some things. For instance, the ticket Priority can be changed to Emergency as it is business impacting. Also, the SLA plan can be changed because this is an issue that should be resolved as quickly as possible. In addition, the department responsible for handling this issue should be escalated to the System Administrators.

What we do when we make these changes is recorded in a thread so others can see the progress of the ticket.

Now, lets say the issue was resolved and we documented the fix and resolved the ticket. The ticket is now under the closed section and everything is running as it should be!
